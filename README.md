## Step 1 - Scraping

Initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs.

* Created a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of the scraping code and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Created a route called `/scrape` that will import the `scrape_mars.py` script and call the `scrape` function. Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Created a root route `/` that will query the Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Created a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. The final product look like below.
